.TH TWOPENCE "3" "@DATE@" "Twopence @VERSION@" "twopence C library"

.SH NAME
twopence \- library routines for orchestrating multi-node tests

.SH SYNOPSIS AND DESCRIPTION
The twopence library allows an application to execute commands remotely
in a multi-node testing scenario.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.\"
.SS Targets
Conceptually, a System Under Test (SUT) is referred to as a "target".
The library is instructed to connect to a target using the
.BR twopence_target_new (3)
function, which takes a string as its first argument, specifying the
target to connect to.
.PP
.in +2
.nf
.B "int  twopence_target_new(const char *target_spec, twopence_target_t **ret);
.fi
.ni
.PP
The target specification consists of a target type and an argument,
separated by a colon.
At the moment, twopence supports the following target types:
.PP
.TP
.B ssh
Execution via SSH, using libssh to talk to the remote SSH server.
The argument is the name of the host to connect to, optionally followed
by the port number:
.IB hostname [: portnum ] \fR.
.IP
The \fIhostname\fP portion may be a name (to be resolved using
regular hostname lookup), but it can also be an IP address. IPv6
addresses must be enclosed in square brackets, like \fB[::1]\fP,
to disambiguate the use of colons.
.TP
.B virtio
This will open an \fBAF_LOCAL\fP socket to talk to a twopence
server (see \fBtwopence_test_server\fP(1)). The argument is the
path of the socket to connect to.
.TP
.B serial
This will open a serial device to talk to a twopence server.
The argument is the path of the serial device.
.TP
.B tcp
This will establish a TCP connection to talk to the twopence
server. The argument is a host name or address, optionally followed
by a colon and a port number. Both IPv6 and IPv4 are supported.
If a hostname is given that resolves to more than one address,
each address is tried in turn, until a connection can be established.
.TP
.B chroot
This will run the twopence server locally in a chroot environment.
The argument is the path of the chroot jail. The test server itself
does not have to be installed inside the jail; it is invoked in the
containing system using the \fB--root-directory\fP option.
.IP
By default, this will try to start the server using \fBexecvp\fP(2), i.e.
by searching the directories given by the \fBPATH\fP environment variable.
If the server binary does not reside in a directory specified by
the seartch path, or if you want to override the search, you can specify
the server's full path in \dBTWOPENCE_SERVER_PATH\fP variable.
.TP
.B local
This will run the twopence server locally, unconfined. Beware that all
operations will be performed on the actual system files!
.PP
Once a handle for the desired target has been obtained, the
application can perform actions on the SUT:
injecting files, extracting files, and executing commands. These
operations and their API calls will be described below
.PP
In addition to these, there are API calls to close the
handle for a target, and to ask the target's twopence server
to exit (this is a no-op in the ssh case).
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.\"
.SS Security
The twopence library doesn't really care much about security.
You have been warned! :)
.PP
When using SSH, it expects authentication to "just work", which
means you need to configure public key authentication. On the
controlling node (which is where the twopence application runs),
you need a private key without passphrase in \fB~/.ssh\fP. On
each SUT, in each of the user accounts you want to be able to
access, you need to add the public portion of that key to the
\fBauthorized_keys\fB file.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.\"
.SS Creating and Destroying Targets
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
The library is instructed to connect to a target using the
.BR twopence_target_new (3)
function, which takes a string as its first argument, specifying the
target to connect to.
.PP
.in +2
.nf
.B "int  twopence_target_new(const char *target_spec, twopence_target_t **ret);
.fi
.ni
.PP
If successful, this function will return 0, and return a pointer to the
target object in \fBret\fP. In case of an error, the function will return
a negative error code.
.PP
In order to dispose of a target object, call this function:
.PP
.in +2
.nf
.B "void twopence_target_free(twopence_target_t *target);
.fi
.ni
.PP

.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.\"
.SS Twopence Status Struct
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.\"
Transactions on a SUT (command execution and file transfers) can fail in
several ways.  If an error occurs on the client side (for instance,
at the communication level), the library functions will return a negative
error code as their return value. These error codes are defined in
\fBtwopence.h\fP. You can use \fBtwopence_strerror()\fP or
\fBtwopence_perror()\fP to display error messages to the user:
.PP
.in +2
.nf
\fB
extern const char *       twopence_strerror(int rc);
extern void               twopence_perror(const char *, int rc);
\fP
.fi
.in
.PP
If there is no local error, the library functions will return 0 and report
the remote status of the transaction in a status object:
.PP
.in +2
.nf
\fB
typedef struct twopence_status {
        int               major;
        int               minor;
} twopence_status_t;
\fP
.fi
.in
.PP
The reason for having two status codes is that some operations have
two stages. Strictly speaking, it wouldn't be necessary to report these as
two separate values, but that's the way it is for now.
.PP
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.\"
.SS File Uploads and Downloads
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.\"
File uploads and downloads are fairly straightforward. In both
cases, the path of the remote file name and a local "iostream"
are needed. These iostreams are not your regular libc \fBFILE\fP
objects, but specific to twopence. In short, these iostreams
encapsulate buffers and regular file descriptors, or a combination
thereof. See the section \(dqTwopence Streams\(dq below for details.
.PP
The primary functions for sending and receiving files are
.PP
.in +2
.nf
\fB
int  twopence_send_file(twopence_target_t *target,
                          twopence_file_xfer_t *xfer,
                          twopence_status_t *status);
int  twopence_recv_file(twopence_target_t *target,
                          twopence_file_xfer_t *xfer,
                          twopence_status_t *status);

typedef struct twopence_remote_file twopence_remote_file_t;
struct twopence_remote_file {
  const char *            name;
  unsigned int            mode;
};

typedef struct twopence_file_xfer twopence_file_xfer_t;
struct twopence_file_xfer {
  twopence_iostream_t *   local_stream;
  twopence_remote_file_t  remote;
  const char *            user;
  bool                    print_dots;
};
\fP
.fi
.in
.PP
The members of \fBtwopence_file_xfer_t\fP have the following semantics:
.TP
.B user
The name of a user's account on the SUT. The server will change its
uid, gid and supplementary groups before opening the file, in order
to ensure correct ownership of the uploaded file, and proper access
rights when downloading.
.IP
If left empty, this will default to \(dq\fBroot\fP\(dq.
.TP
.B local_stream
The local iostream to read from, or write to, respectively. When
sending a file, twopence will read all data from this iostream
until it hits an EOF condition.
.IP
Not setting \fBlocal_stream\fP is an error.
.TP
.B remote
This specifies the remote file's name and permissions. If
\fBremote.name\fP is not absolute (i.e. it does not start with '/'),
it is interpreted relative to the home directory of \fBuser\fP.
.IP
When uploading a file, \fBremote.permissions\fP are used to set
the permissions of the file. If the file exists already, its
permissions are adjusted nevertheless.
\fBremote.permissions\fP default to \fB0644\fP unless the field is
set to a non-zero value by the caller.
.IP
Not setting \fBremote.name\fP is an error.
.TP
.B print_dots
If set to true, the library will print a single '.' character for
every block of data transferred. The size of these blocks is
arbitrary, so do not expect to be able to use these as an indication
for the amount of data transferred.
.PP
\fBCaveats:\fP 
Note that both the twopence server and SSH will refuse to open anything
but regular files. When using SSH, downloading files from \fB/proc\fP
or similar virtual file systems will result in empty files. This is due
to a problem in the SSH daemon.
.PP
.B "Return value:
Upon return, the \fIstatus\fP structure will contain standard Linux
errno values. If the operation completed successfully, both
the \fBmajor\fP or \fBminor\fP fields will be zero. In case of an error,
either of them will contain a non-zero error code, but never both.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.\"
.SS Running commands
When running a command on the SUT, it is connected to three iostream
objects - for standard input, output and error, respectively.
The content of the stdin stream is transmitted to the SUT and piped
into the running command, whereas the command's standard output and
error is transferred back to the control node and written to the
stdout and stderr streams.  This happens whenever data is available,
so that it is possible to handle remote commands interactively.
.PP
Note, however, that the twopence command execution is not intended
to be a full-blown replacement for a remote shell. For instance,
most terminal applications using libraries like ncurses will not
work very well, if at all.
.PP
The primary function for executing a command is
.PP
.in +2
.nf
\fB
int              twopence_run_test(twopence_target_t *target,
                          twopence_command_t *cmd,
                          twopence_status_t *status);

typedef struct twopence_command twopence_command_t;
struct twopence_command {
  const char *            command;
  const char *            user;
  long                    timeout;
  bool                    request_tty;
  bool                    background;

  twopence_iostream_t     iostream[__TWOPENCE_IO_MAX];
  twopence_buf_t          buffer[__TWOPENCE_IO_MAX];
};

void             twopence_command_init(twopence_command_t *cmd,
                          const char *cmdline);
void             twopence_command_destroy(twopence_command_t *cmd);
\fP
.fi
.in
.PP
In order to run a command remotely, you need to set up a
\fBtwopence_command_t\fP struct. This is done by calling
\fBtwopence_command_init\fP and pass in the command line
to execute. Other fields of the command struct can be modified
subsequently, either by accessing them directly or by using
.PP
After the command has completed, the command object should
be disposed of by calling \fBtwopence_command_destroy\fP.
It is not safe to modify or destroy the command while
execution is still in progress.
.PP
The members of \fBtwopence_command_t\fP have the following semantics:
.TP
.B command
This specifies the command line to be executed. It is passed to
\fB/bin/sh\fP on the remote host for execution, so that shell wildcards
etc work.
.TP
.B user
The name of the user to run this command as. The command will be
executed with the privileges of this user, and the current working
directory set to the account's home directory.
.IP
If not set, this defaults to \fBroot\fP.
.TP
.B timeout
The timeout, in seconds, within which the command is expected to
complete. If the runtime exceeds this limit, the command is
terminated and a \fBCOMMAND_TIMEOUT\dP error is returned.
.IP
The default timeout is 60 seconds.
.TP
.B request_tty
If this is false, the remote command is run with standard input and output
connected to normal unnamed pipes. If this flag is set, a pseudo-tty pair
is allocated instead, and the command is runs with its stdio connected to
the slave tty. However, there are currently no provisions for transmitting
the \fBTERM\fP variable, the terminal size or SIGWINCH signals.
.IP
This option is currently only implemented for the ssh target type.
It defaults to false.
.TP
.B background
If set, requests that the command is run asynchronously, meaning that
\fBtwopence_run_test\fP returns immediately without waiting for the
command to complete. The return value is a positive integer
uniquely identifying the running transaction, similar to a Linux
process ID.  See below for a description on how to wait wait
for and retrieve the exit status of backgrounded commands.
.TP
.B iostream
This array containts the three twopence iostreams connected to the command,
 indexed by \fBTWOPENCE_STDIN\fP, \fBTWOPENCE_STDOUT\fP, and \fBTWOPENCE_STDERR\fP.
.TP
.B buffer
These buffer objects can be used to set up any of the three iostreams
to read from or write to a memory buffer.
.PP
.B "Return value:
Upon return, the \fIstatus\fP structure will contain the command's exit status
in \fBmajor\fP, and \fBminor\fP will be 0. If the command died with a signal,
\fBmajor\fP will be set to \fBEFAULT\fP and \fBminor\fP will contain the signal
number.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.\"
.SS Setting up the Command's iostreams
After initializing a command object, its iostreams can be set up
using a number of utility functions.
.PP
Note that output streams can be connected to more than one
"substream". For instance, your application may want the output
of the test programs to be written to your application's standard
output, while at the same time capturing the data in a buffer.
Currently, an iostream will support up to 4 substreams.
.PP
.in +2
.nf
\fB
typedef enum {
  TWOPENCE_STDIN,
  TWOPENCE_STDOUT,
  TWOPENCE_STDERR
} twopence_iofd_t;

void             twopence_command_iostream_redirect(twopence_command_t *cmd,
                          twopence_iofd_t which, int fd, bool closeit);
twopence_buf_t * twopence_command_alloc_buffer(twopence_command_t *cmd,
                          twopence_iofd_t which, size_t size);
void             twopence_command_ostream_capture(twopence_command_t *cmd,
                          twopence_iofd_t which, twopence_buf_t *bp);
void             twopence_command_ostreams_reset(twopence_command_t *cmd);
void             twopence_command_ostream_reset(twopence_command_t *cmd,
                          twopence_iofd_t which);
\fP
.fi
.in
.PP
If you want to connect a stream to a regular file descriptor, you would
just use \fBtwopence_command_iostream_redirect\fP like this:
.PP
.nf
.B "  twopence_command_iostream_redirect(&cmd, TWOPENCE_STDOUT, 1, false);
.fi
.PP
This would cause the output of the remote command to be written to the
local standard output of your application. The \fBcloseit\fP flag tells
twopence whether to close the file descriptor when the stream is destroyed.
In this case, you probably want to hang onto file descriptor 1, and
thus you would pass \fBfalse\fP as \fBcloseit\fP parameter.
.PP
Similarly, you can redirect the remote command's standard output
to a buffer. This can happen instead of or in addition to redirecting
the output to a file. To do so, you would allocate a buffer using
\fBtwopence_command_alloc_buffer\fP, and connect the iostream to
this buffer using \fBtwopence_command_ostream_capture\fP.
.PP
Note that the buffer being \(dqallocated\(dq is a \fBbuffer\fP
member of the command struct, which is just being resized to the
requested size.
.PP
.nf
.in +2m
.B "twopence_command_t cmd;
.B "twopence_status_t status;
.B "twopence_buf_t *bp;
.B ""
.B "/* Initialize the command */
.B "twopence_command_init(cmd, "ps lax");
.B ""
.B "/* Resize the stdout buffer */
.B "bp = twopence_command_alloc_buffer(&cmd, TWOPENCE_STDOUT, 128 * 1024);
.B ""
.B "/* Capture stdout and stderr in this buffer */
.B "twopence_command_ostream_capture(&cmd, TWOPENCE_STDOUT, bp);
.B "twopence_command_ostream_capture(&cmd, TWOPENCE_STDERR, bp);
.B "rc = twopence_run_test(target, &cmd, &status);
.B ""
.B "/* Do something with the content of the buffer */
.B "...
.B "/* Done! */
.B "twopence_command_destroy(&cmd);
.in
.fi
.PP
Just like the stdout and stderr streams, you can redirect standard
input. However, stdin does not really support multiple substreams -
you cannot read from several substreams concurrently, and reading them
sequentially turns out to make things pretty complicated. Which is
why, right now, you can connect stdin to \fIeither\fP a buffer or
a file descriptor. The functions to be used are the same as in the
stdout/stderr case described above:
.PP
.nf
.in +2m
.B "twopence_command_t cmd;
.B "twopence_status_t status;
.B "twopence_buf_t *bp;
.B ""
.B "/* Initialize the command */
.B "twopence_command_init(cmd, \(dqfdisk /dev/sdc\(dq);
.B ""
.B "/* Put the fdisk's input into a buffer */
.B "bp = twopence_command_alloc_buffer(&cmd, TWOPENCE_STDIN, data_len);
.B "twopence_buf_append(bp, data, data_len);
.B ""
.B "/* Make stdin read from this buffer */
.B "twopence_command_ostream_capture(&cmd, TWOPENCE_STDIN, bp);
.B "rc = twopence_run_test(target, &cmd, &status);
.B ""
.B "/* Done! You've destroyed your partition table! :-) */
.B "twopence_command_destroy(&cmd);
.in
.fi
.PP
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.\"
.SS Running commands asynchronously
Twopence supports \fIbackgrounding\fP commands, i.e. running them
asynchrounously. This can be requested simply by setting the \fBbackground\fP
member of the command struct to \fBtrue\fP.
.PP
When backgrounding a command, \fBtwopence_run_test\fP will return
immediately, allowing you to schedule more commands. The return value
will be a \(qdtransaction id\(qd that identifies the command. This
is an integer value. Commands scheduled on the same target will have
different IDs, but commands scheduled on different targets may be
assigned the same ID.
.PP
Once you have created all commands you want to run, you have to wait
for them using the \fBtwopence_wait\fP function:
.PP
.in +2
.nf
.B "int  twopence_wait(twopence_target_t *, int xid, twopence_status_t *);
.fi
.in
.PP
The \fBxid\fP argument should be either 0, telling twopence to wait for
just any command to complete, or should be a transaction ID returned
by a previous call to \fBtwopence_run_test\fP on this target.
.PP
If there are no pending commands, \fBtwopence_wait\fP will return 0.
If an error occured while executing a transaction, or while waiting
for it, a negative erorr code will be returned. If a command
completed without local error, its exit status will be copied to the
\fBtwopence_status_t\fP argument, and its transaction ID will be returned.
.PP
Note, by the time \fBtwopence_run_test\fP returns, it is not guaranteed
that the backgrounded command has actually been started on the SUT. Remote
commands will only be started, and will only be able to perform I/O,
while the client application is executing the internal twopence event
loop. This is currently only guaranteed to happen when twopence is
actively waiting for a command to complete, i.e. either while in
\fBtwopence_run_test\fP (executing another command synchronously),
or while in \fBtwopence_wait\fP.
.PP
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.\"
.SS Passing Environment Variables to Commands
It is possible to pass environment variables to a command, taken from two
possible sources: you can assign environment variables to a target as well
as a command. When executing a command on a given target, these two
environments are merged, with the command environment taking precedence over
the target's environment.
.PP
You can manipulate the environment using these functions:
.PP
.in +2
.nf
\fB
void  twopence_target_setenv(twopence_target_t *target,
                          const char *name, const char *value);
void  twopence_target_passenv(twopence_target_t *target,
                          const char *name);
void  twopence_command_setenv(twopence_command_t *cmd,
                          const char *name, const char *value);
void  twopence_command_passenv(twopence_command_t *cmd,
                          const char *name);
\fP
.fi
.in
.PP
The \fBpassenv()\fP functions instruct twopence to pass the variable
from the local process environment. In other words, the following two
commands do the same thing:
.PP
.in +2
.nf
\fB
twopence_target_passenv(target, "TERM");
twopence_target_setenv(target, "TERM", getenv("TERM"));
\fP
.fi
.in
.PP
There are currently not functions for querying a target's or a command's
environment.
.\" --------------------------------------------------------------
.\"
.\"
.SS Interrupting a Command
Twopence provides a mechanism to interrupt a command that is
being run synchronously (i.e. \fBbackground\fP is set to \fBfalse\fP),
using this function:
.PP
.in +2
.nf
.B "int  twopence_interrupt_command(twopence_target_t *target);
.fi
.in
.PP
This will not work equally well on all targets. In particular, while the
SSH protocol does provide for commands to deliver signals to a command
remotely, this is currently not implemented in openssh's sshd. A workaround
exists in the twopence library, but it is far from perfect.
