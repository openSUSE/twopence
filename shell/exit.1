.SH NAME
twopence_exit \- exit the test server

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B twopence_exit [
.I OPTION
.B ]... 
.I TARGET

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B twopence_exit
makes the remote test server exit on the system under test (SUT).
.PP
The SUT can be accessed by any means provided by Twopence:
virtio (for QEmu/KVM virtual machines) or serial
(with a null-modem cable), with exception of the ssh access method.
This access method and the exact
location of the SUT are defined by the
.I TARGET
parameter. The program
.B twopence_test_server
must be installed and running on the SUT (that's the one that will
exit).

.SH OPTIONS
.I TARGET
obeys the following syntax:
.PP
.IP \fBvirtio:\fR\fISOCKETNAME\fR
for the access through virtio to
a QEmu/KVM virtual machine. \fISOCKETNAME\fR is the filename of
the UNIX domain socket used by the virtio channel. It can be defined
for example with help of
.BR virt-manager (5)
command.
.PP
.IP \fBserial:\fR\fIDEVICENAME\fR
for the access through a serial port. \fIDEVICENAME\fR is the filename
of a UNIX character device describing the serial port.
.PP
.I COMMAND
is the command to run. It is provided as a single argument,
so make sure to quote it if it contains spaces.
.PP
The syntax for SSH does not make any sense, because SSH servers are
not programmed for leaving on demand.

.SH EXAMPLES
Example syntax for the virtio access method:
.IP \fBtwopence_exit\ virtio:/tmp/sut.sock\fR
it will use
.I /tmp/sut.sock
to communicate with the QEmu/KVM host.
.PP
Example syntax for the serial access method:
.IP \fBtwopence_exit\ serial:/dev/ttyS0\fR

.SH BUGS
Do not expect any security from Twopence. Use with care. You've been warned.
.PP
For the moment, only one session with the remote host can be used at
a time.
